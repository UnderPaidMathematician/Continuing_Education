## Pizza Order

# Instructions

Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. 

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. 

```
Small Pizza: $15
```

```
Medium Pizza: $20
```

```
Large Pizza: $25
```

```
Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
```

```
Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
```

```
Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1
```

# Example Input

```
size = "L"
```

```
add_pepperoni = "Y"
```

```
extra_cheese = "N"
```

# Example Output

```
Your final bill is: $28.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# Hint

1. Think about what you've learnt about multiple if statements and see if you can reduce the number of lines of code while having the same functionality.

# Test Your Code

Before checking the solution, try copy-pasting your code into this repl: 

[https://repl.it/@appbrewery/day-3-4-test-your-code](https://repl.it/@appbrewery/day-3-4-test-your-code)

This repl includes my testing code that will check if your code meets this assignment's objectives.
